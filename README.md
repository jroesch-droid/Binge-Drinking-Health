# Binge-Drinking-Health

## Introduction
The culmination of this study is to further the knowledge of factors that are linked to binge drinking, whether it be mental health, physical health, emotional support, or another factor. I aim to look deeper at these factors concerning excessive alcohol consumption.


## Methods
I analyzed complete data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS, N = 102,635). I then stratified the data in terms of a binary outcome of either partaking in binge drinking or not at all. This was followed by analyzing a logistic regression model of the characteristics: physical health, mental health, sex, income, emotional support, children, life satisfaction, general health, and sleep.


## Key Results
Poor mental health days (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.02-1.03, p < 0.001),  frequency of emotional support (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01-1.04, p = 0.001), and general life satisfaction (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.13-1.19, p < 0.001) are linked to excessive drinking habits.

## Conclusion
Individuals with poor mental health, poor life satisfaction, and a lack of emotional support are all more likely to drink more recklessly. Also, the more children that reside in the household, the more likely that individual is to be a binge drinker. Furthermore, I found that males are more likely to be binge drinkers than females, after adjusting for all the variables.
